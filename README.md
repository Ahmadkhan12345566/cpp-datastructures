# Data Structures
This definitely my interest in the various data structures and implementations of them in various way.

>This library focus on Stacks, Queues, LinkList, Doubly Link List, Tree, BST, AVL Tree, Hash Table, Binery Heap, Max Heap, Min Heap and Graph.

### A typical top-level directory layout

    .
    ├── procedural                    # procedural data-structures code format
    ├── stl-structures                # follow the STL procedure code format
    ├── main.cpp                      # main.cpp
    └── README.md                     # Introduction and TODO List

## TODO
* Array, Max, Min and Sorting, Circular etc.
* Stack
* Queue
* List (Link List, Doubly Link List)
* Tree (BST, AVL, Heap, Priority Queue, Binary Heap)
* Graph (Directed, Undirected, Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, Traversals BFS, DFS)
